*Please note that all watchtower components are under heavy development and the norm is that things will break. Please be patient with us until the first stable release.*

# Overview

This repository provides documentation for **Watchtower** and pointers to the other repositories that make up the system.

### Features

The following are partially or fully implemented features:

* Automated Cloud Incident Lifecycle Management
* Flexible API designed for easy integration of 3rd Party Solutions
* Designed with scalability in mind
* Integrated with HP Monasca, Apache Kafka, Camunda, and Rundeck
* Multi-tenant support

### Components

As of v1.0.0, it has 6 components of which four provide running services:

* **watchtower-common** - contains common, reusable, code for all watchtower components. It facilitates communication between components through common objects and provides Json serialization for them
* **watchtower-monitoring** - its primary role is to get, process, and forward events from the monitoring solutions to **watchtower-workflow**
* **watchtower-automation** - handles communication with automation engines
* **watchtower-workflow** - provides an interface between the workflow engine and the rest of Watchtower's components
* **watchtower-workflow-camunda** - is a component of watchtower which is deployed onto Camunda and contains both the BPM workflow and the REST service to which **watchtower-workflow** connects
* **ansible-watchtower** â€“ is Ansible role script which allows easy installation of Watchtower on a single host


### Roadmap

The current roadmap is focused on extending current functionality through additional components:

* Python client
* User interface in Horizon
* Anomaly detection and prediction in Monasca
* Event aggregation and correlation
* Root cause analysis tools in Horizon
* Integration with Keystone or another Identity Management Solution
* Integration with Hurdle and Cyclops

# Getting started

Soon to come!
